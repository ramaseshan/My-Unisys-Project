My-Unisys-Project
=================

This Project deals with Cloud Computing. It mostly deals with Application security over Cloud computing.

When in college we are used to look around for domains that are latest so as to show-off ourselves as too geeky.
This project was started as a venture of such a crazy search. When looking around crazily for probllems on cloud computing i came across this interesting problem, which talked about the following stuff.
1. The security of application when kept on a public cloud.
2. What will companies do when they want to share the applications they developed for the general public and also use for their own personal applications ??
3. How will companies what to give access only to a particular product than to giving/sharing the whole product itself over to the users ?

So exploring over more about company level applications I came to know about private cloud as something that is to be used only inside companies(in simple words its like private git repo).
So my naughty mind starting to think over an project that would deal with the above aspects and also to come up with a solution for the same.

It was at that time Unisys had also called up for their "Unisys-Cloud 20/20 v4.0". At that point I formed a team with a guide and started to proceed with this simple idea into an application/a product.

This application has two different or to be more clear two important aspects that made this application win the overall 3rd prize in this All-India level contest.

1. The Product focussed on an important aspect of keeping the product in the private cloud itself and forwarding the requests to the provate cloud.
2. It also involved a Monitoring system that was continously monitoring the requests and reaponse over to the admin of the monitoring system.

There was one thing that we could resolve within our team. We never knew/still now know if there is actually a bug when we leave the public cloud access the private cloud.

It has a lot more crazy stuff that we did.. If you are more interested in this product always feel free to contact me so that we could sechudule a talk over the same.
